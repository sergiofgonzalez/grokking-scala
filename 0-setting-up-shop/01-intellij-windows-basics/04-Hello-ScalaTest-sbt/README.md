# 04 &mdash; Hello ScalaTest SBT  
> Running unit tests on Scala using the ScalaTest framework

The project demonstrates how to add the ScalaTest framework dependency to a SBT project and write a simple test case.

The *ScalaTest* framework is included adding the following line to the `build.sbt`:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.0.5" % "test"
```
