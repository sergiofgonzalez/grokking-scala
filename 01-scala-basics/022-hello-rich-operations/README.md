# 022 &mdash; Hello, Rich Operations (snippet)
> rich operations in Scala

## Description
Another Scala feature is implicit conversion. This technique is bassed on the provision of a *rich wrapper* for each basic type that provides additional operations on it such as max, min, round, etc.


## Running the Snippet
The snippet is intended to be run from `sbt consoleQuick`. Once inside the console type:
```
scala> :load hello-rich-operations.scala
```
