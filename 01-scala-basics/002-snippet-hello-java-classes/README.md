# 002 &mdash; Hello, Java classes (snippet)
> instantiating and using a Java ArrayList in a Scala snippet

## Description
Illustrates how you can instantiate a Java `ArrayList` in a Scala snippet and use some of its methods.
It also demonstrates how by simply typing the variable name, you get the type and *string* contents in the console.

Note that Scala uses `[]` instead of the diamond operator `<>` to specify the type of objects a generic type will hold.

## Running the Snippet
The snippet is intended to be run from `sbt consoleQuick`. Once inside the console type:
```
scala> :load hello-java-classes.scala
```
