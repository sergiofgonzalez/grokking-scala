# 017 &mdash; Hello, tuples (snippet)
> illustrates basic concepts of Scala tuples

## Description
A tuple is another Scala inmmutable container that can contain different types of elements (unlike lists, which can be List[Int] or List[String] but not both).
Tuples can be used to return several objects from a method without having to define a class to hold those objects.
Also, instantiation and access is really convenient
