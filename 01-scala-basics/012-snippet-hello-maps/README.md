# 012 &mdash; Hello, Maps (snippet)
> using Map

## Description
A `Map` is an immutable collection of keys and values.
The elements of the maps are *tuples*, which Scala allows you to define as 
```scala
val tuple2 = (key, value)
```

which is syntactic sugar for 
```scala
val tuple2 = new scala.Tuple2(key, value)
```

Then, the `Map` can be created as:
```scala
val map = Map(("key1", "value1"), ("key2", "value2"))
```

and individual values can be accessed like `map("key")`.

But there's even a more expressive way to work with *Maps* in Scala:
```scala
var capital = Map("US" -> "Washington", "France" -> "Paris")
capital += ("Japan" -> "Tokyo")

capital("France")
```
