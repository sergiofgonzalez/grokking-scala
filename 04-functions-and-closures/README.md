# 04 &mdash; Functions and Closures
> organizing code with functions

## [001 &mdash; Class Methods (snippet)](./001-snippet-class-method)
Illustrates how to define an *object* that exposes a function and also defines a private function.

## [002 &mdash; Functions within Functions (snippet)](./002-snippet-functions-within-functions)
Illustrates another way of organizing code by defining functions within functions (what is known as local functions).

## [003 &mdash; Hello, Function Literals (snippet)](./003-snippet-function-literals)
Illustrates the concept of function literals (aka lambdas).

## [004 &mdash; Placeholder Syntax in Function Literals (snippet)](./004-snippet-placeholder)
Illustrates the peculiarities of the placeholder syntax with function literals.

## [005 &mdash; Partially applied functions (snippet)](./005-snippet-partially-applied-functions)
Introduces the concept of partially applied functions.

## [006 &mdash; Closures (snippet)](./006-snippet-closures)
Introduces the concept of closures for Scala.

## [007 &mdash; Special Function Call Forms (snippet)](./007-snippet-special-function-call-forms)
Illustrates the syntax for variable length args, named parameters and default arg values.

## [008 &mdash; Tail Recursion (snippet)](./008-snippet-tail-recursion)
Illustrates the concept of tail-recursive calls and some optimizations that Scala implements for those.

## [009 &mdash; Passing Function Values as Arguments (snippet)](./001-snippet-passing-functions-as-args)
Illustrates the syntax for passing function values as arguments to functions and methods.

## [010 &mdash; The Concept of Currying (snippet)](./002-snippet-currying)
Introduces the concept of currying, a functional programming technique that allows a function to be applied several argument lists.

## [011 &mdash; Writing New Control Structures (snippet)](./003-snippet-new-control-structures)
Illustrates how to write new control structures (thanks to currying and using `{ }` instead of parentheses) that feel like native control structures.

## [012 &mdash; By-Name Parameters (snippet)](./004-snippet-by-name-parameters)
Illustrates how to use by-name parameters when defining custom control structures that don't need additional parameters other than the function value they receive.

## [e01 &mdash; Using Class Methods from an Application](./e01-class-method-application)
Demonstrates how to consume the class defined in [001 &mdash; Class Methods (snippet)](./001-snippet-class-method) as an application.
