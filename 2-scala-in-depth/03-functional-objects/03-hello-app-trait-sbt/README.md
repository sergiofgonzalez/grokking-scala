# 03 &mdash; Hello App Trait SBT   
> Scala application project using the `App` trait using SBT model

A simple Scala application using SBT that can also be run on IntelliJ IDE. The application defines a class `ChecksumCalculator` and an entry point in `FallWinterSpringSummer.scala` that extends from `scala.App` to illustrate how to define an entry point for a Scala application usin the `App` trait.

The application can be run and debugged on IntelliJ IDE if you open the project, and you can also run it from the SBT shell using the `run` task.
