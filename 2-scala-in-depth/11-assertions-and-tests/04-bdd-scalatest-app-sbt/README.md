# 04 &mdash; BDD with ScalaTest Application SBT   
> Using ScalaTest BDD testing style on the *layout elements* class hierarchy

The example features a test in `src/test/scala` using the BDD approach. Also, the *matcher's DSL* is introduced.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.0.5" % "test"
```
