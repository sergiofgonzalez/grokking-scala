# 05 &mdash; BDD with Specs2 Application SBT   
> Using Specs2 BDD testing style on the *layout elements* class hierarchy

The example features a test in `src/test/scala` using the BDD approach with the [*Specs2*](https://etorreborre.github.io/specs2) framework. Both the *Unit specification* and the *Acceptance specification* are shown.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.0.5" % "test"
```
