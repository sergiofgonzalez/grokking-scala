# 02 &mdash; Hello Scala Application SBT   
> Scala application project using SBT model

A simple Scala application using SBT that can also be run on IntelliJ IDE. The application defines a class `ChecksumCalculator` and an entry point in `Summer.scala` to illustrate how to define an entry point for a Scala application.

Running and debugging in IntelliJ is pretty straightforward: you just open the project and edit the source code files and whenever you want to run you just right-click on the `Summer.scala` file and select Run.

On SBT is also pretty straightforward, you just have to start sbt on the command line and then select the `run` task, maybe followed by some parameters the application might expect:

```bash
