# 02 &mdash; Classes and Objects
>  classes, fields and methods in the Scala programming language

## [001 &mdash; Hello, class (snippet)](./001-snippet-hello-class)
Illustrates how to create a class in Scala and the concept of a companion object.

## [002 &mdash; Hello, Scala application](./002-hello-application)
Illustrates how to create a Scala application object from scratch.

## [003 &mdash; Hello, App trait](./003-hello-app-trait)
Illustrates how to create a Scala application object that uses the `App` trait.

## [004 &mdash; Hello, Class Constructor (snippet)](./004-snippet-class-constructor)
Illustrates the peculiarities of class constructors in Scala.

## [005 &mdash; Overriding Class toString (snippet)](./005-snippet-override-to-string)
Illustrates how to override `toString` in a class definition.

## [006 &mdash; Adding methods (snippet)](./006-snippet-class-methods)
Illustrates how to add methods to class definitions in Scala.

## [007 &mdash; Adding Auxiliary Constructors (snippet)](./007-snippet-auxiliary-constructors)
Illustrates the rules and syntax for adding auxiliary constructors to a class.

## [008 &mdash; Hello, Private Fields and Methods (snippet)](./008-snippet-private-fields-and-methods)
Illustrates how to add private fields and methods to an Scala class.

## [009 &mdash; Methods as operators in a class (snippet)](./009-snippet-methods-as-operators)
Illustrates the rules and syntax for adding auxiliary constructors to a class.

## [010 &mdash; Hello, Method Overloading (snippet)](./010-snippet-method-overloading)
Illustrates how to do method overloading in an Scala class.

## [011 &mdash; Hello, Implicit Conversions (snippet)](./011-snippet-implicit-conversions)
Illustrates the rules and syntax for adding auxiliary constructors to a class.

## [012 &mdash; Abstract Classes (snippet)](./012-snippet-abstract-classes)
Illustrates the particularities of *abstract classes* in Scala.

## [013 &mdash; Parameterless Methods (snippet)](./013-snippet-parameterless-methods)
Illustrates how to define parameterless methods and the difference between parameterless and empty-paren methods and how to use each one of them.

## [014 &mdash; Extending classes (snippet)](./014-snippet-extending-classes)
Illustrates how to create subclasses using the `extends` keyword and the consequences of extending a class.

## [015 &mdash; Overriding Methods and Fields (snippet)](./015-snippet-overriding-methods-and-fields)
Illustrates how to override methods with fields, and methods with methods.

## [016 &mdash; Parametric Fields (snippet)](./016-snippet-parametric-fields)
Introduces the concepts of parametric fields as a way to define class fields in the class definition to reduce code redundancy. 

## [017 &mdash; Invoking Superclass Constructors (snippet)](./017-snippet-invoking-superclass-constructors)
Introduces the syntax for calling the superclass constructor from a subclass. 

## [018 &mdash; Polymorphism and Dynamic Binding (snippet)](./018-snippet-polymorphism-and-dynamic-binding)
Illustrating polymorphism and dynamic binding.

## [019 &mdash; Final Members and Classes (snippet)](./019-snippet-final-members-and-classes)
Illustrates the use of `final` to prevent methods from being overridden and classes from being extended.

## [020 &mdash; Composition and Inheritance (snippet)](./020-snippet-composition-and-inheritance)
Basic example illustrating how to change an inheritance relationship for a composition.

## [021 &mdash; Factory Objects (snippet)](./021-snippet-factory-objects)
Illustrates how to define factory methods in a companion object to centralize object instantiation. As a consequence, the classes that implements a hierarchy can be completely hidden from the clients.

## [e01 &mdash; More on the App trait](./e01-more-on-app-trait)
Similar to [003 &mdash; Hello, App trait](./003-hello-app-trait) but concatenating the `args` array with a list of default values to calculate.

## [e02 &mdash; Element 2D lib](./e02-snippet-element)
The implementation of the Element 2D library &mdash; the running example used from examples 12 to 21.
